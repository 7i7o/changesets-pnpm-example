# Changesets + pnpm Example

This repo works as an example for a basic TS project that automatically publishes the package to the NPM Registry.

It uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle our package and [@changesets/cli](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md) to automate the release and publish flow.
